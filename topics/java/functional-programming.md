# Functional Programming

* What is Functional Programming?  
Paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions,
and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
Calling a Function with the same arguments always produces the same result.

* What is a Lambda Expression?  
it is a function which can be created without belonging to any class.

* what is a functional interface?  
Is an interface with only one abstract method, they can have only one functionality
to exhibit.  
Lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface.

* Where are Lambda Expressions used?  
As event listeners or in Functional Programming with Java Stream API.
